### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Sapan Reddy**](https://www.sapanreddy.com), a Software Engineer based in the United States.

💻 **Full-Stack Engineer** | 🤖 **ML Explorer** | 🎓 **Master’s in Computer Science**


I build things end-to-end — from pixel-perfect UIs to scalable backends — and occasionally teach machines how to be a little smarter than yesterday.

## 🧠 About Me

- 🛠️ Full-stack engineer who enjoys turning complex problems into clean, maintainable systems  
- 🤖 Stepping confidently into the **Machine Learning** world (models, data, and lots of “why is this overfitting?” moments)
- 🎓 Master’s degree in **Computer Science**
- 🧩 Big fan of **systems that scale**, **code that reads well**, and **learning things the hard way (once)**

Recruiters usually ask *“frontend or backend?”*  
My answer: **yes**.

## 🧰 Tech I Work With

**Fullstack**
- React / Next.js / TypeScript
- HTML, CSS, Tailwind, modern UI patterns
- Node.js / Python / Java 
- REST APIs, GraphQL, authentication, caching
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis

**Core ML Stack**
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn
- Feature engineering, model training & evaluation
- Supervised & unsupervised learning
- Data preprocessing & pipelines

**Dev & Cloud**
- Git, Docker, CI/CD
- AWS / GCP / Azure (as applicable)

## 🎯 What I’m Looking For

- Impactful **full-stack roles**
- Teams that value **engineering fundamentals**
- Opportunities where ML meets real-world products

If your team likes engineers who:
- can ship features end-to-end  
- understand both users *and* systems  
- and aren’t afraid of learning new domains  

…we’ll probably get along well.
